# ksp-f9-flight-gnc
Flight software for automating the flight of a Falcon 9 in KSP using kOS

## Requirements
Obviously you will need Kerbal Space Program, but you will also need the following:
- [SpaceX Launchers pack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/71323-142-launchers-pack-spacex-pack-v52-released-april-3rd/)
- [kOS](https://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/)
- [Trajectories](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/162324-131-trajectories-v200-2018-02-15-atmospheric-predictions/)

Trajectories isn't necessary yet because there is currently a conflict between the latest KSP update and the way kOS grabs data that prevents it for working. It will eventually be needed for landing the boosters, but I can't write that yet :(
